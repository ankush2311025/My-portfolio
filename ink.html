        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="hello-text">Hello! I am <b>Ankush Sharma</b></p>
        My journey into web development started with a curiosity for how things work online, and it quickly transformed into a passion for creating intuitive digital experiences.
        My goal is to merge aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that every project not only looks great but also performs seamlessly.
            From an early age, I've been fascinated by how technology impacts our lives, and this passion led me to choose computer science as my field of study.
      I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to contribute meaningfully to this field.
         Thank you, and I'm eager to embark on this journey.
